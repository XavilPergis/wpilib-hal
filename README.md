# wpilib_sys

This crate aims to create Rust bindings to the HAL using more idiomatic Rust design patterns.

Also be sure to check out a more mature (and probably cleaner) crate [here](https://github.com/robotrs/rust-wpilib).
It has bindings to a bunch of WPILIB and some basic abstractions for programming robots

WPILIBC and WPILIBJ, and some library headers are in [this repo](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib).
