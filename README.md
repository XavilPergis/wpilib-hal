# wpilib-hal

This crate aims to create Rust bindings to the HAL using more idiomatic Rust design patterns.

### Also see
Also be sure to check out a more mature (and probably cleaner) crate [here](https://github.com/robotrs/rust-wpilib).
It has bindings to a bunch of WPILIB and some basic abstractions for programming robots

WPILibC and WPILibJ, and the library headers used in this crate are in [this repo](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib).

### Current TODOs
  - Determine thread safety of functions
  - Serial IO
